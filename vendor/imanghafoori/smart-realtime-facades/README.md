# Smart Real-time Facades:

## Do not lose IDE auto-completion with real-time facades!

Real-time facades in laravel are great, but they have a problem. When you use them, you quickly fall out of ide auto-completion and you are out of confidence.
This package generates the facade file with enough doc-blocks to provide you with all the neat IDE helps. Nice?

It works exactly like the internal laravel realtime facades.

### Install:

```bash
composer require imanghafoori/smart-realtime-facades --dev
```

### Usage:

You do not need to do anything, it regenerates your facade files if they need to be updated when you call them.
